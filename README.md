# HC_SG40_Origin

Slow song (like Observe / omen)

such a gravitas 5
your ideas biased 5
no internal origin 5
think once

such a gravitas
your ideas x x 
inner origin(s)
biased to core

such a gravitas
your ideas no internal origin
but you pull all that effort into spreading them
think once not twice and resubscribe
keeping us (alive)
my mind has dual tags

call me a moth - with no reason to die
flying to fire - why can't you see my eyes (oh right)
shining in a different spectrum of light
blink and i'm gone, i wasn't a lie
i was apart
i was so distant
too much involved in your meddling business (?)
not really regret but I was your constant
you thought i was a threat



into the depths of the night i roll
what else do you want, more?
naah, you always wanted the whole
i can't or i shouldn't and i won't - so piss off




ANALYSE THE VERSE PROGRESSION:

Bitch, I'm dead, bitch, I'm dead, I feel like like I'm fucking dead
Got a knife left in my back, all I see is fucking red
I'm not scared of the past, not afraid in the end
Nothing wrong up in my head, all I need now is revenge
Only thing you will see if you ever try to cross me
Demigod, demi-deity moving godspeed
Swiftly, I erase you, if you harm me
Oddly, I don't think you even want it
Honest, let me thank you, let's be honest
I need this, it's my reason for evolving
Sleepless, I can't sleep, bitch, but I'm nodding
Paralysis, take me till the morning
Hate this, I can't shake it, it's been so long
Dreaming, I can see shit, I'm not sleeping
Blinking, thoughts they creep in, keeps me thinking
Breathing, am I breathing? I can't breathe, bitch
Demons, yes, I see them, they love weakness
Me, bitch, I'm the king, bitch, this is treason
Freezing their advances, bitch, I'm laughing
Screaming, they can't take me, I delete them
Battle, In the astral, I'm projecting
Shadows, like the gallows, keep on pressing
Only, now I'm lonely, and I'm ready
Frozen, as I lay here, I just let be
White noise, shake me up, my body heavy
Fight it, with my mind just by forgetting
Letting go of what I thought that I was and
Focusing on what is I'll become, bitch
